Power BI project analyzing water infrastructure progress, cost, and population impact
# Njiwa Water Infrastructure Analytics Project

## Overview
This project analyzes the progress, cost efficiency, and social impact of a national water infrastructure program using Power BI and DAX.

The dashboard is designed to help both the public and decision-makers understand:
- Project completion status
- Budget vs actual spending
- Cost allocation by region and improvement type
- Population access to clean water

## Problem Statement

## Key Features
- Project completion rate and cumulative progress tracking
- Budgeted vs actual cost analysis
- Cost breakdown by province, town, and improvement type
- Population impact metrics based on water quality and queue time
- Multi-level analysis (national, provincial, town)
